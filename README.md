# Image Processing 

**Image Enhancement and Histogram Equalization**

This Python project focuses on image manipulation and enhancement techniques for educational purposes. It provides functionalities to adjust image properties such as brightness, contrast, scaling, and applies histogram equalization. The primary goal is to offer a practical learning experience in image processing fundamentals, particularly in the context of enhancing image quality and visual perception.

**Features:**
1. **Brightness Adjustment:** Users can modify the brightness of images by increasing or decreasing intensity levels while preserving the overall image structure.
2. **Contrast Enhancement:** The project offers tools to enhance image contrast, improving the visibility of details and enhancing overall image quality.
3. **Scaling:** Users can resize images while maintaining aspect ratio and minimizing distortion, allowing for better integration of images in various contexts.
4. **Histogram Equalization:** The project implements histogram equalization techniques to redistribute pixel intensities, leading to improved contrast and visual clarity in images.

**Dependencies:**
- NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- Pillow: A Python Imaging Library that adds image processing capabilities to Python.
- PyOpenGL: Python bindings for OpenGL, providing access to graphics hardware acceleration.
- GLFW: A multi-platform library for creating windows with OpenGL contexts and managing input events.

**Usage:**
- Users can run the provided Python script to interactively manipulate images using keyboard and mouse inputs.
- Image loading and saving functionalities are available, allowing users to work with their own images.
- Various keyboard shortcuts are provided for convenient image manipulation, including brightness adjustment, contrast enhancement, scaling, and rotation.

**Note:**
- This project is designed for educational purposes and provides a hands-on learning experience in image processing techniques.
- Users are encouraged to experiment with different image manipulation operations and observe their effects on image quality and visual appearance.

**Disclaimer:**
- This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for commercial or production purposes without proper validation and testing.
